manganese
---
An image viewer inspired, and necessitated, by my love for Gyro7's [mangodl](https://github.com/Gyro7/mangodl) CLI. At the moment it's only capable of displaying images but I intend to add downloading capabilities to a fork at some point.
It's all done with [Gio](https://gioui.org), so it's ready for any platform!
